This is a converter from TRUMPH's TOPS to linuxcnc's RS274 NC languages. 

After my NC control unit burned down, i decided to use open-source one. Hovewer, original TRUMPH's CNC unit comes with proprietary CAM system (named TOPS) that is used to convert drawings to programs. This code's goal is to convert TOPS output intro LinuxCNC programs.

I do not believe that someone will face the same problem and would need this code. But It can be usefull as a template for converter program between different numeric control verdor's languages. It's pretty simple, modular and can be customized in a simple way.
